# It is a LEAF lock: nothing under it acquires ``_sessions_lock`` or a session's
# ``history_lock`` (the fan-out's own lock is likewise a leaf), so it is safe to
# take while holding either of those.

    nests one fan-out inside another. The queued-prompt paths make that
    reachable — a busy submit records ``session["transport"]`` as the prompt's
    transport, which is the fan-out itself when two clients are attached, and
    the drain hands it back here after a disconnect has collapsed the slot to a
    single client. Nesting would blind every single-level reader of the slot
    (``FanoutTransport.contains``, the steer-authority scan, detach) to the
    inner peers, so a client inside the inner fan-out could never be found,
    parked, reaped, or granted authority over its own turn.

    The ladder, for the leaf newcomer that always reaches it:

    * same object already in the slot → no-op;
    * the slot already fans out → attach into it;
    * the slot is empty / stdio / the parked drop sentinel → take the slot,
      which is exactly what the old rebind did;
    * otherwise → wrap the incumbent and the newcomer in a ``FanoutTransport``
      so both clients keep streaming.

    A non-peer newcomer (stdio, drop sentinel) never displaces a live client:
    an activate/resume dispatched without a bound websocket must not silence the
